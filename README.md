# Encapsulation

> "Encapsulation is one of the fundamentals of OOP (object-oriented programming). It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. "
> - [Rebus](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/encapsulation/)

_Encapsulation_ is the idea of grouping together your data with the functions that use it. That's it! (for now :)  There are many ways to achieve this, but the end result is code that is easier to understand and nicer work with.

Heads up!  In this module you'll be encountering some of the most important (and most challenging!) aspects of the JavaScript language `this`, inheritance & classes.  These are all features of JS that allow you to encapsulate functions & data for readable, reusable code.

Along the way you will get your first introduction to one of the main programming paradigms in JS: _object oriented_.  At their simplest level, programming paradigms are just different answers to the same question "How will I group my data and my functions?".

## About the Projects

Projects in this module will have all the same concerns as projects in the last module, they'll just be organized a little differently.  In the last module every function was a free-floating function written in a separate file and required separately into your .html files.

In this module you'll learn how to:

- _Encapsulate_ your application's data with the functions that operate on it using _object oriented programming_.
- Organize your code base using _ES Modules_ (`import` and `export`). Yo
- Reuse your methods with _inheritance_ and ES6 `class`es

__*this is an individual project*__

Your project this week is to build something inspired by the [Practical JavaScript Tutorial](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) (best tutorial ever).

To help you get off the ground here is a [starter repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/encapsulation-week-1-starter). There is already some code to

You don't find a todo app so interesting?  not a problem!  Your group is free to invent a new project idea, just be careful about _scoping_!

### Lesson Plan

> during class

#### Before Break

#### After Break

- Isolate: 8. `Object.create`
- Integrate: 3. `Object.create`

### Project

> after class

List Manager!  Following up on the tutorial from last week, your group will be building a web page that allows users to create as many lists as they want.  You will need to refactor the todo list from WatchAndCode into a prototype object that can be used to create so list instances.  A suggestion:  users can input a title and create a new list with that title.

Along with prototypes, your group will be exploring `import` and `export`.  This week's [starter repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/starter-encapsulation-list-prototype) has the basics already in place for you.  Enjoy!
